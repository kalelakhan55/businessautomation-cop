Three nodes will be created out of a shared EAP installation.

- "standalone" node is equivalent to "both" mode of installation hosting a Business Central and a KIE Server
- Nodes 2 and 3 are equivalent to "kie" mode of installation each hosting a single KIE Server

Offset on nodes will be auto-assigned.
All KIE Servers share the same KIE Server ID and are thus managed as a group from Business Central

### Multi node PAM installation on different hosts

### Unmanaged KIE Server installations alongside managed ones

By default `pam-eap-setup` will install KIE Servers in managed mode. However it is possible to install one or more
KIE Servers in unmanaged mode on their own or alongside managed ones.

To do this, use the `-o custom` option. For example the following invocation
will install a Business Central, two KIE Servers in managed mode using the
Business Central as their controller and one KIE Server in _unmanaged_ mode.

> NOTE: When specifying an unmanaged KIE Server node, all nodes are going to be
> installed in separate EAP instances. EAP Instances will not be shared.

The KIE Servers on EAP nodes 1 and 2 are going to have the KIE Server Id of
"remote-kieserver" and are going to be deployed in managed mode. The KIE Server
in EAP node 3, is going to have the Id of "ks1" and is going to be installed in unmanaged mode.

The result of this setup as far as deployments go is that KJAR deployments to
KIE Servers 1 and 2 would happen through Business Central, while any deployments
to KIE Server 3 would have to happen by explicitly invoking the REST API
endpoints offered OOTB.

> The [Using the REST
> API](../using-the-rest-api#direct-deployment-to-a-kie-server) document
> contains a section about deploying to KIE Server directly using the REST API
        
## Prerequisites

Download binaries and place them in the same directory as this script. Most recent version will be used depending on the files present.

For EAP.7.2 the file "*jboss-eap-7.2.0.zip*" is required.

- EAP.7.2 patching is supported. To enable patching place either the latest patch file, for example "`jboss-eap-7.2.8-patch.zip`", in the same directory as the script. The script will use the latest patch version available.
- More information about supported configurations can be found at <https://access.redhat.com/articles/3405381>

Depending on PAM version the following files are required:

        |PAM Version| Files                                                                               |

## Usage

Invoke with `-h`, i.e. `./pam-setup  -h` for usage info:

        Will install PAM on a standalone EAP node or an EAP cluster. Execute this script on each
        node that will be part of the cluster.

        usage: pam-setup.sh [-h help]
                             -n ip[:node]
                             -b [kie|controller|both|multi=2...], defaults to 'both'
                             [-c ip1:port1,ip2:port2,...]
                             [-s smart_router_ip:port]
                             [-o option1=value1[:option2=value2...]]

        example: pam-setup.sh -n localhost

        Options:
            -n : the IP[:port] of the node it will operate on, default is localhost:8080

            -b : Configure PAM installation
                     kie : only the KIE ES component
              controller : only the Business Central component without the KIE ES
                    both : (default) full suite of PAM along with a separate KIE ES having
                           same node as controller, suitable for a development environment

                   multi : a number designating multi-node managed KIE Server installations,
                           with the following configuration:

                           Please note that 'ukie' for unamanaged KIE Servers can only be used
                           with the 'custom' option

            -c :  Mandatory for 'kie' mode of PAM installation, ignored in other modes
                  Specify list of controllers that this KIE ES should connect to.
                  List of controllers in the form of comma-separated list of 'IP:PORT' pairs
                  e.g. 10.10.1.20:8080,192.168.1.34:8350

            -s : Only for KIE ES, optional. Specify Smart Router location, eg 10.10.1.23:9000

            -o : Specify additional options. To specify multiple options use ':' as separator. 
                 Example: '-o option1=value1[:option2=value2:...]'

                 Supported options are:

## Nodes configuration

The script will configure the installation with the following settings:

- Will use `standalone-full-ha.xml` instead of `standalone.xml` by renaming files. Original files are also kept.
- Sampe startup scripts are generated for each node installed
- KIE Servers installed will all have the ID `remote-kieserver` and managed as a group from Business Central
- EAP logging will be modified for CONSOLE output along with the regular FILE output
- GIT, Maven and Indexer directories will be relative to the base dir of the node, i.e. `$JBOSS_HOME/standalone` or`$JBOSS_HOME/node2` depending on node created.
BC or KIE nodes will be created using the same EAP base installation, as per <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/350683>
- Will use a custom `settings.xml` file based on <https://access.redhat.com/maven-repository>
- Passwords are secured with a keystore. More information at : <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3669631>
- Identify workbench as DecisionCentral instead of BusinessCentral for RHDM installations, <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/4840041>
- node-identifier property in EAP configured as per <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/721613>
- ActiveMQ Artemis disk threshold increased as per <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/4390511> to better handle near full disks
- Enable CORS for first four nodes of KIE Server as per <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/4036301> and <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3713131>
-- To enable CORS in an OCP environment, please refer to <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6859471>
- Enabling logging messages that will show when a project or space is deleted in RHPAM or Decision Manager as per [KB6139932](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6139932)

### Install location - Installation log

By default PAM will be installed in a directory named `pam` in the current
directory. `pam` will be created if it does not exist. Installation location can
be overridden by the `install_dir` option. The startup script will be named
after the installation location with a `go_` prefix.

The `install_dir` value will be used to place the generated startup scripts.

Example:
  - `./pam-setup.sh` will install PAM in a directory named `pam` and the startup script will be named `go_pam.sh`
  - `./pam-setup.sh -o install_dir=wick` will install PAM in a directory named `wick` and the startup script will be named `go_wick.sh` in the `wick` directory

An installation log can be obtained by specifying the `-o logfile=file` option. `file` is optional and will default to `pam-setup.log` if not specified. An installation log will not overwrite existing contents of the `file` .

An installation log would look similar to the following:

### Development vs Production Mode

RHPAM can be configured in `development` or `production` mode as detailed in [Configuring the environment mode in KIE Server and Business Central](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_process_automation_manager/7.7/html-single/packaging_and_deploying_a_red_hat_process_automation_manager_project/index#configuring-environment-mode-proc_packaging-deploying)

Setting the run mode will also affect [Duplicate GAV detection in Business Central](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_process_automation_manager/7.7/html-single/packaging_and_deploying_a_red_hat_process_automation_manager_project/index#project-duplicate-GAV-con_packaging-deploying)

To specify the run mode of Business Central and KIE Server specify the `run_mode` option. Depending on the value specified, the following properties will be configured:

| run_mode value                        | `development` | `production` |
|:--------------------------------------|:-------------:|:------------:|
|`org.guvnor.project.gav.check.disabled`| `true`        | `false`      |
|`org.kie.server.mode`                  | `development` | `production` |

The default `run_mode` for `pam-setup.sh` is `development`.

### Enabling DEBUG logging

Enabling `debug_logging` will have the effect of placing the following definitions in your `standalone.xml` file.

```xml
<logger category="org.jboss.as.domain">
    <level name="TRACE"/>
</logger>
<logger category="org.wildfly.security">
    <level name="TRACE"/>
</logger>
<root-logger>
    <level name="DEBUG"/>
    <handlers>
        <handler name="FILE"/>
        <handler name="CONSOLE"/>
    </handlers>
</root-logger>
```

This will also log login related events. The combined effect will be quite extensive amount of logging that could have a detrimental effect to performance. It is recommended that for normal operations the logging level is switched to informational level by replacing the `DEBUG` directive above with `INFO`.


### Additional Configuration

There are a multitude of properties than can be configured for Business Central and KIE Server. `pam-eap-setup` offers shortcuts for the most common of them, but there are still a lot that are left out. To include any of these extra configuration parameters file `pam.config` can be used to specify parameters that should be included.

Parameters specified in the `pam.config` files are included both in Business Central as well KIE Server deployments. Each component will pick the relevant parameters so the presence of extraneous parameters in the system properties is not a problem.

By default, `pam.config` has the following contents:

```
#
# comment
#
brokerconfig.maxDiskUsage               95

# return formatted dates in JSON respones instead of seconds
# org.kie.server.json.format.date       true

# override KIE Server ID
# org.kie.server.id                     execution_server

# LDAP: check https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5100821 
# org.jbpm.ht.admin.user                processManager

# Oracle: check https://access.redhat.com/solutions/4460791
# org.kie.server.persistence.dialect   org.jbpm.persistence.jpa.hibernate.DisabledFollowOnLockOracle10gDialect

# process variable values longer than 255 chars in VariableInstanceLog
# https://access.redhat.com/solutions/917923 plus database schema changes
# org.jbpm.var.log.length             1000
#
# for Human Tasks
# org.jbpm.task.var.log.length        4000

#
# enable Prometheus endpoints
# access metrics at: http://localhost:8080/kie-server/services/rest/metrics
# 
org.kie.prometheus.server.ext.disabled  false
```

- The default entries for `pam.config` will enable Prometheus endpoints. Prometheus endpoints are available from version 7.4.0 onwards and can be accessed through `http://{{ kie-server  }}/services/rest/metrics` URL. More information can also be found at https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_decision_manager/7.9/html-single/managing_red_hat_decision_manager_and_kie_server_settings/index#prometheus-monitoring-con_execution-server

Add as many configuration parameters as required separating the parameters from its value by at least a space.

Any parameters specified in `pam.config` will take precedence over ones specified by default in `pam-eap-setup` or through command line options.


### Configuring an Oracle datasource

By specifying the Oracle related parameters an Oracle datasource will be configured. Example invocation:

```bash
OJDBC_LOCATION=$PWD/oracle_jdbc_driver/ojdbc8.jar
ORACLE_HOST=hostname_or_ip
ORACLE_PORT=port_to_connect_to
ORACLE_SID=oracle_sid
ORACLE_USER=oracle_user
ORACLE_PASS=oracle_password

./pam-setup.sh -b both -o ojdbc_location=$OJDBC_LOCATION:\
                          oracle_host=$ORACLE_HOST:oracle_port=$ORACLE_PORT:\
                          oracle_sid=$ORACLE_SID:\
                          oracle_user=$ORACLE_USER:oracle_pass=$ORACLE_PASS
```

All parameters are required for the configuration to be successful. The Oracle JDBC URL that will be configured is of the following format:

```bash
jdbc:oracle:thin:@//ORACLE_HOST:ORACLE_PORT/ORACLE_SID
```

The OJDBC driver must be provided and placed in a directory readable by the installation script. Please make sure that the version of OJDBC driver you are providing matches the version of the Oracle database you are using.

The datasource will be named `OracleDS` and will be configured to use the `oracle.jdbc.xa.client.OracleXADataSource` class for connections. The [When RHPAM is configured to use Oracle as a database, the first start-up will work fine but every subsequent restart will show ORA-00955 and ORA-02275 in the server.log file](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3494221), KB3494221, article is also taken into account.

System properties set also include

- `org.kie.server.persistence.ds` set to `java:jboss/OracleDS`
- `org.kie.server.persistence.dialect` set to `org.hibernate.dialect.Oracle10gDialect`

It is also advisable to check whether KB4460791 [What is the supported oracle dialect for RHPAM 7?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/4460791) is applicable in your case. If it is, just uncomment the relevant line in the `pam.config` file and (re)run the installation.


### Post-commit git hooks integration
You can install a post-commit git hook implementation at the same time as installing Business Central with the following options.

The following post-commit git hook implementation are supported:
- [bcgithook](https://github.com/redhat-cop/businessautomation-cop/tree/master/extras/bcgithook)
- [kiegroup](https://github.com/kiegroup/bc-git-integration-push)

> **IMPORTANT**
> Additional configuration is required after installing a git hook. Please refer to the respective documentation for configuring the installed post-commit git gooks.
>  
>  Installation of the post-commit git hooks is attempted after finishing the RHPAM installation. In case the git hook integration fails RHPAM would still be fully functional, albeit without post-commit git hooks. 

| Option  | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
|`git_hook`| name of the git hook implementation to be installed, either `bcgithook` or `kiegroup`. |
|`git_hook_location`| the location of the named `git_hook` implementation to be installed.<br>Valid values are `[ download\|path-on-the-local-disk ]`. <br>`git_hook_location` is only taken into account if `git_hook` location has a valid value |
|`bcgithook_config`| location of the configuration for the `bcgithook` implementation<br/>Valid values are `[ global\|local ]`.<br/>`local` will allow for separate configuration per RHPAM installation (in the same machine).<br/>Please refer to `bcgithook` documentation for more details. |

Examples for `git_hook_location` values

#### for bcgithook

      git_hook_location value  | what is means
      -------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------
           (empty)             | will look for bcgithook on the local disk based on the 
                               | 'businessautomation-cop' repository structure, which should be 
                               | at the 'CURRENT_DIR/../bcgithook' directory
                               | if not found at that path, 'git_hook_location' will switch to 'download'
      -------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------
           download            | Will try to download 'businessautomation-cop' repository from
                               | https://github.com/redhat-cop/businessautomation-cop/archive/master.zip
                               | If succesfull the downloaded file will be uncompressed and used
      -------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------
         /path/to/bcgithook    | Will use this path and fail if bcgithook cannot be found

#### for kiegroup

* It is recommended that the kiegroup implementation is downloaded and built beforehand as pam-eap-setup cannot recover a built process if it does not work for whatever reason or the artefact cannot be located.


      git_hook_location value   | what is means
      --------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------
           (empty)              | same as 'download' 
      --------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------
           download             | Will try to download the implementation repository from
                                | https://github.com/kiegroup/bc-git-integration-push/archive/master.zip
                                | If succesfull the downloaded file will be uncompressed, built through 
                                | maven and used.
      --------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------
         /path/to/kiegroup .JAR | The path where the binary artefact of the implementation can be found
                                | The path should point at the .JAR that results from builting the kiegroup
                                | implementation


### Configuring EAP
`pam-eap-stup` will install RHPAM modules into a local EAP installation. Often additional configuration of EAP is required, such as installing a JDBC module or setting up LDAP authentication, etc. `pam-eap-setup` is able to configure EAP using command files you provide in the `addons` directory. These files should contain [JBoss CLI](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_enterprise_application_platform/7.2/html-single/management_cli_guide/index) commands and will be executed while running EAP in [embedded mode](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_enterprise_application_platform/7.2/html-single/management_cli_guide/index#running_embedded_server).

By default `pam-ep-setup` will look for files named after the node it is setting up. For example, while setting up `node1` (aka `standalone`) the file `addons/node1_config` will be executed if found, `addons/node2_config` for `node2` and so on.

Files containing JBoss CLI commands can also be specified with the `-nodeX_config` parameter substituting `X` for the corresponding node number. So for example:

- `node1_config=ldap_configi.cli` will execute file `ldap_config.cli` while setting up `node1` (aka `standalone`)
- `node2_config=jdbc_datasource.cli` will execute file `jdbc_datasource.cli` while setting up `node2`

If both a file in the `addons` directory corresponding to a node is found and an additional file is specified with the `-nodeX_config` option, then the file in the `addons` directory will be executed first followed by the file specified in the `-nodeX_config` option. For example, if

- a file named `addons/node1_config` is present, **and**
- a file is specified with `-node1_config=jdbc_datasource.cli`
- **then** the file `addons/node1_config` will be executed first followed by `jdbc_datasource.cli`

Same for subsequent nodes by specifying `node2` for node 2, `node3` for node 3 and so on.

#### Enabling access_log

The file `addons/access_log` will enable basic logging to access_log for EAP. To use this file specify it in the `-o` options like `-o node1_config=addons/access_log`. This file implements the [How to enable access logging for JBoss EAP 7?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2423311) KB article.
