# Business Automation Community of Practice
Business Automation or Red Hat Process Automation Manager is a portfolio that includes a web tool for authoring, rules management application and building business processes (Workbench/Business Central).

This repository is meant to help bootstrap users of the Red Hat Process Automation Manager Portfolio to get started in building and using Red Hat Process Automation Manager (PAM) and Red Hat Decision Manager (DM) to build applications to run in different runtimes such as JBoss enterprise platform, spring boot and cloud-native using Kogito(Quarkus implementation for JBPM and drools).

# Red Hat Process Automation Manager (PAM)
PAM is a platform for developing business process management (BPM),
business rules management (BRM), Decision Model and Notation (DMN), and business resource optimization and complex event processing (CEP).

# Red Hat Decision Manager (DM)
DM is a platform for developing and authoring business rules management (BRM), business resource optimization and complex event processing (CEP).

## Decision Model and Notation (DMN) 
It is a standard established by the Object Management Group (OMG) for describing and modelling operational decisions.

## Business Process Management (BPM)
It's a tool to help model, analyze, measure, improve, automate business processes and decisions based on the JBPM framework.

## Business rules management (BRM)
It provides a core Business Rules Engine (BRE) and full runtime support for Decision Model and Notation (DMN) models.

## Cloud Native - Kogito
Kogito is a framework that compiles your business process and business rules in a more cloud-native approach taking advantage of the latest technologies (Quarkus, Knative, etc.), you get amazingly fast boot times and instant scaling on orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.


## What's In This Repo?

This repo contains process automation(JBPM) and business rules(Drools and DMN) related quickstarts of several different flavours.
